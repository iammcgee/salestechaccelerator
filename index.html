  <h2>Why Remote Sales?</h2>
  <p>High-ticket remote sales is one of the fastest-growing industries online. Businesses are spending billions on coaching, consulting, and digital education — but they need skilled communicators to handle the leads. That’s where you come in.</p>
  <p>Instead of clocking in for a fixed wage, you earn based on performance. That means no ceiling. No waiting for promotions. Just results = reward.</p>
  <p>And unlike traditional sales, you don’t chase strangers or knock on doors. You work from your laptop, use proven scripts, and talk to warm prospects who already showed interest.</p>

  <p>Our 12-week Remote Sales Accelerator gives you everything you need to get started fast:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ <strong>1-on-1 mentorship</strong> from top performing setters</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Proven scripts</strong> & conversation frameworks</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Real client work</strong> during training (earn while learning)</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Weekly live calls</strong> for coaching & accountability</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Path to promotion</strong> — setter → triager → closer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You’ll gain real experience, start earning commissions, and position yourself for six-figure potential within your first year — if you stay consistent.</p>

  <h2>What You’ll Earn</h2>
  <p>During training, you can start earning immediately:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>$100 per qualified lead you book</li>
    <li>10% commission on every deal your leads close ($3K–$6K range)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As you advance into triager and closer roles, your commissions can grow to 20-40%. That means your effort compounds ... you can literally stack income by mastering the process.</p>
  <p>Example: 10 qualified leads in a week = $1,000. Four of those close = $1,200–$2,400 more. That’s $8K–$13K per month ... working from home.</p>

  <h2>Your Next Step</h2>
  <p>Every success story started with a single decision: the decision to stop waiting and start building. Your discovery call is free, simple, and could change the entire direction of your life.</p>
  <p>During the call, we’ll walk you through how the system works, what you’ll need to succeed, and whether you’re a fit for the program. There’s no pressure. Just clarity.</p>

  <h2>The Fork in the Road</h2>
  <p>There’s a point in every person’s life where the excuses run out. The alarm goes off, you hit snooze again, and that quiet voice inside your head whispers ... “This can’t be it.”</p>
  
  <p>You drag yourself to a job that doesn’t excite you. The same traffic lights. The same paycheck that disappears before the month even ends. You scroll through social media watching other people travel, work from their laptops, live on their own terms… and part of you wonders, *“What did they figure out that I didn’t?”*</p>

  <p>Here’s the truth: most people never figure it out ... not because they’re not smart or capable, but because they never learned the one skill that sets free men and women apart from everyone else: <strong>the ability to sell.</strong></p>

  <p>Sales isn’t manipulation. It’s communication. It’s the art of connecting with another human being and helping them make a decision that changes their life. Once you master that, you’ll never go broke again. Because where there are people, there are problems ... and where there are problems, there are solutions that need to be sold.</p>

  <p>Maybe you’ve been conditioned to think you need a degree, a résumé, or permission. You don’t. You just need the right mentorship, the right system, and the right work ethic to apply it. That’s what this program gives you — step-by-step, with accountability and proof baked in.</p>

  <p>But let’s be real: this isn’t for everyone. Most people won’t do it. They’ll scroll away. They’ll go back to “maybe next month.” They’ll talk themselves out of the very thing that could change everything.</p>

  <p>They’ll wake up in the same apartment. The same stress. The same uncertainty. And five years from now, they’ll tell themselves a new story about why it just “wasn’t the right time.”</p>

  <p>But you ... if you’re still reading this far ... something inside you already knows that’s not you. You’re done waiting. You’re done watching other people win. You’re done giving away your best years to someone else’s dream.</p>

  <p>This is your line in the sand moment. You can feel it. You can taste it. You can almost see the version of yourself that did it ... the one who stopped hesitating, made the call, got trained, and started earning. The one who’s building something that actually matters.</p>

  <p>Imagine six months from now. You wake up and open your laptop — not to clock in, but to check your commissions. You’ve got a team. A mentor. A community that pushes you to win. You’ve replaced your job income — maybe doubled it. You control your time. You decide when you work, where you live, and what your days look like.</p>

  <p>And all of it started because you took one simple step ... you booked the call.</p>

  <p>There are two roads from here. One keeps you exactly where you are. The other leads to freedom, mastery, and a skill that will feed you for life. You already know which one you want.</p>

  <p>So stop reading about other people’s success stories. Write your own.</p>

  <p><strong>Apply now.</strong> Don’t think. Don’t wait for the “perfect” moment. Just do it — because every day you delay, someone else steps into the opportunity you walked away from.</p>

  <p>It’s not luck. It’s not magic. It’s a system — and you’re one decision away from being on the right side of it.</p>

  <p>So let’s do this. Let’s make the next chapter of your life one that you’re proud to read out loud.</p>

  <h2>The Kitchen Light Moment</h2>
  <p>Let me tell you another  story.</p>

  <p>There was a guy ... let’s call him “you.” You wake up one morning, open the fridge, and it’s basically a museum of sadness: half a bottle of mustard, some off-brand water, and a single tortilla. You stare into it like it’s going to magically turn into opportunity. It doesn’t.</p>

  <p>You check your phone ... one new email. It’s a bill. Not the kind of bill you can ignore, either ... the kind that looks at you like, “So… what’s the plan, champ?”</p>

  <p>You laugh to yourself, but not the happy kind — that little dry exhale that says, “Yeah, this can’t be life.”</p>

  <p>You go to work. You sit in traffic. Same podcast, same steering wheel, same building. You clock in, nod at your coworkers who also hate being there, and do your thing. Lunch break hits — you scroll. You see some random person on Instagram talking about how they work from a beach, selling something called ‘high-ticket offers.’ You roll your eyes. Must be fake, right?</p>

  <p>But something in you lingers on it. Because deep down, you’re thinking, “I could do that.”</p>

  <p>Except you don’t. You go home. You heat up the tortilla. You watch Netflix. The same routine repeats. For weeks. For months. You start calling it “just surviving.”</p>

  <p>And then one night ... maybe 11:47 PM ...you’re sitting there in your kitchen with the light humming overhead, scrolling again. You stumble onto this exact page. You read about people booking calls, learning skills, working from home, actually making real money without losing their sanity. And for a second, you feel it again ... that old spark. The one that says, “I’m not done yet.”</p>

  <p>You think about what it would feel like to wake up and not dread Mondays. To check your commissions instead of your balance. To work for yourself instead of surviving for someone else. You imagine your friends asking how you did it ... and you saying, “I stopped waiting.”</p>

  <p>You can laugh at the story ... but you know it’s true. Because you’ve lived it. You’re probably living it right now.</p>

  <p>And here’s the plot twist: this story doesn’t have to end the same way it’s been going. You can flip it. Rewrite it. Be the main character who finally decided, “No more tortillas and tired mornings. No more waiting for permission.”</p>

  <p>You don’t need to quit your job tomorrow. You don’t need to know everything. You just need to take one step that changes your trajectory... that one move that starts your freedom story.</p>

  <p>This discovery call *is that step.*</p>

  <p>So yeah ...laugh, nod, whatever. But when you close this page, remember this: that little voice in the back of your head isn’t crazy. It’s calling you out. It’s saying, “You were made for more than this.”</p>

  <p>And if you ignore it again, you already know how the next chapter goes. Same light. Same fridge. Same sigh.</p>

  <p>Or… you click this button, book the call, and change the whole story.</p>

  <p>It’s your movie. You decide how the next scene plays out.</p>

  <h2>P.S. — Let’s Be Real for a Second</h2>
  <p>You don’t need another motivational quote or fancy funnel to tell you what you already know — that where you are right now isn’t where you’re supposed to stay.</p>

  <p>If you’ve read this far, it’s because something inside you knows you’re capable of more. You’ve got the drive, the hunger, the potential — but you’ve been stuck waiting for the “right time.”</p>

  <p>Here’s the truth: there is no perfect time. There’s just a moment — one like this — when the door cracks open and you either walk through it or you don’t. And most people don’t. They scroll. They save it for later. They go back to the same routine, waiting for “someday.”</p>

  <p>But every person you’ve seen winning in this industry — every single one — had a moment just like this, where they made a small, simple decision: *“I’m in.”* That’s it. No permission. No magic. Just one step forward.</p>

  <p>This is that step for you. It’s not a pitch. It’s an invitation. To get trained. To earn while you learn. To finally see what happens when you stop surviving and start building something real.</p>

  <p>So if you’re still thinking about it — stop thinking. Click below. Book the call. Let’s talk. Even if it’s not the right fit, you’ll walk away with clarity, direction, and proof that people like you are doing it every single day.</p>

<p><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> On the next page, when you see the question <em>“Name of the person you were referred to this interview by”</em>, type <strong>Canaan McGee</strong> to make sure your application is tracked correctly and fast-tracked to my team.</p>
  <a href="apply.html" class="cta" target="_blank">See If You Qualify →</a>

  <p>Because five years from now, one of two things will be true: you’ll either remember this page as the start of your story — or as the moment you almost did something about it.</p>

  <p>Make it the first one.</p>
